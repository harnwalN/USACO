# USACO-Related Practice Files

My C++ and Java code from practice problems. Most solutions are for problems from USACO.org, so files are generally named with the division, year, month, and problem number, and problem name. All bronze solutions and some silver problems I did a while back are in Java. Problems I did more recently will be in C++.

Ex: *S2017_F3_WhyDidTheCowCrossTheRoad3.cpp* is a C++ solution for "Why Did the Cow Cross The Road III", the 3rd Silver division problem from February 2017.

There are also a few selected problems from CodeForces, CSES, and my solutions from AIO 2024. Warning: A lot of problem solutions may be incomplete, I might go back and mark certain files as unfinished at some point. Made this repo to track my progress over time (will I update it consistently? we'll find out)
